# Better-Error Project 

The Better-Error project is a tool designed to facilitate error message management during software development. Its main objective is to translate error messages generated by different programming languages into a specified language, allowing developers to better understand and resolve issues in their code.

## Main Features 👨🏻‍💻

Better-Error primarily focuses on translating error messages. It provides a library of predefined translations for commonly encountered error messages in Python. Developers, Teachers and Students can integrate this library into their projects to obtain error messages in their preferred language, making it easier to understand and debug the code.
