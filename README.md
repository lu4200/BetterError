# Better-Error Project 

The Better-Error project is a tool designed to facilitate error message management during software development. Its main objective is to translate error messages generated by different programming languages into a specified language, allowing developers to better understand and resolve issues in their code.

## Main Features 👨🏻‍💻

Better-Error primarily focuses on translating error messages. It provides a library of predefined translations for commonly encountered error messages in Python & JavaScript. Developers, Teachers and Students can integrate this library into their projects to obtain error messages in their preferred language, making it easier to understand and debug the code.
